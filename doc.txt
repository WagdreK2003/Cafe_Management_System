Core Backend Technologies:

Python: The core programming language for your backend logic.

Flask: A lightweight and flexible web framework that allows you to build a RESTful API to serve data to your frontend. It's an excellent choice for this project due to its simplicity and extensibility.

SQLAlchemy: A powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. This will allow you to interact with your database using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to work with.

A Database: Based on the SQL schemas in your README.md file, a relational database is the most suitable choice.

Database Recommendations
Your project requires a database to store and manage critical information, including:
Menu items: Their names, prices, images, and categories.
Orders: Total amounts and status.
Inventory: Item names, quantities, and stock status.

here are the recommended options:

PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, data integrity, and robustness. It's a great choice for production-level applications.

MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system. It's widely used and has a large community, making it easy to find support and resources.

You can use either of these databases with Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Flask-Specific Libraries
To build a robust and functional API with Flask, you should use a few key extensions and libraries:

Flask-SQLAlchemy: This extension simplifies the integration of SQLAlchemy into your Flask application.

Flask-RESTful or Flask-RESTX: These extensions make it easy to build REST APIs in Flask. They help define endpoints for your frontend to interact with, such as GET /menu_items or POST /orders.

Python-dotenv: This library is used to manage environment variables, which is a best practice for handling sensitive information like database credentials.

Flask-Migrate: An extension that handles database migrations with Alembic, allowing you to easily manage changes to your database schema as your project evolves.
